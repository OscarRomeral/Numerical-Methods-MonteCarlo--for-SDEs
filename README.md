# Brownian Motion Approximation and Lévy-Ciesielski Representation

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks for simulating and approximating Brownian Motion using various mathematical techniques, specifically targeting Monte Carlo methods and the Lévy-Ciesielski representation. The project includes two main parts:

1. **Monte Carlo Approximation of Brownian Motion**  
   This section focuses on simulating and approximating one-dimensional standard Brownian motion using Monte Carlo techniques, including proofs of approximations for realizations of Brownian paths.

2. **Lévy-Ciesielski Representation of Brownian Motion**  
   This section demonstrates the Lévy-Ciesielski representation of Brownian motion and applies Multilevel Monte Carlo methods to compute Brownian marginals. These techniques are valuable for applications such as option pricing in financial contexts.
